People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come together to share, collaborate and learn. Hackers talk code.  Artists share their creativity.

          <p>Over the years, some questions come up again and again.  Here they are, with
answers.  Of course, if you don’t see your question asked and answered, ask on
the mailing list.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-bring">Should I bring…</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>…my projects and tools?</dt>
  <dd>Oh yes, you should!  Bring your whole project group and take a code retreat or
whatever needs to be done — and get fruitful exchanges with the other
participants.  Please let us know what things you want to bring, so that we
can arrange appropriate space for you.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>…my camping gear?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, please!  Bring your tents, mattresses, sleeping bags, pillows, blankets.
We have some to share, but never enough.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>…my family?</dt>
  <dd>You are welcome to bring your husband, kids, wife, parents, cousins, friends.
Please let us know the details in advance, so we can help to find appropriate
accommodation for you.  There are plenty of things to do for all ages and
interests.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>…a spontaneous session?</dt>
  <dd>Yes.  The unconference is all about spontaneous sessions.  During the main
conference days, priority is given to curated sessions, but you may be able to
schedule yourself into unused spaces.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="when">When…?</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>When can I come?</dt>
  <dd>The unconference, school programme and set-up for the main conference all
begin on 23<sup>rd</sup> Nov 2017.  We have the venue until 2<sup>nd</sup>
Dec 2017.  If you would like to come earlier or stay later, you should make
your own arrangements.  Contact the <a href="/mailinglist/">mailing list</a> for pointers.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>When is the main conference?</dt>
  <dd>23 Nov to 2nd Dec 2017.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>How do I get there?</dt>
  <dd>See the <a href="/travel/">Travel page</a> for details.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>How will be the weather?</dt>
  <dd>TODO</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>What about lodging and food?</dt>
  <dd>See the <a href="/where/">Venue page</a> and the <a href="/accommodation/">Accommodation page</a> for details.
<!-- This says nothing about food!  We need to know about food! --></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>I am a foreign national.  Do I need a Protected Area Permit (PAP)?</dt>
  <dd>Not if you are camping on-site.  Read the relevant section on the
<a href="/accommodation/">Accommodation page</a> for more details.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>I am concerned that I am too young / too old / an introvert / a single female /</dt>
  <dt>a single male / a robot / something totally different.</dt>
  <dd>Read our note on providing a safe and friendly place for everyone.  In
previous years, we had all age groups around.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>My family is concerned that this will be way too dangerous!</dt>
  <dd>Please have a look at the blog posts from participants from previous
editions, and maybe show them the report or project description.  If they are
primarily concerned about the travel, shout out on the <a href="/mailinglist/">mailing list</a>
There is a good chance that others will be travelling the same route around
the same time you intend to travel.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="sliding-scale">Sliding scale</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Contribution</dt>
  <dd>This event is solely community driven and run by volunteers. Please see where else
you can contribute too! This democratic (or even meritocratic) approach is mirrored
on every layer, and so is it for the money bit, too.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Types of financial contribution</dt>
  <dd>We want to provide everyone the opportunity to come, so we kindly ask everyone to
give as much as s/he can afford.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>What does that mean?</dt>
  <dd>We have four levels of contributions. Please choose the one that suits your budget.
    <ul>
      <li>Base: can be 0, if you cannot afford otherwise</li>
      <li>Reasonable: covers basic costs of food and lodging</li>
      <li>Nice: all costs covered, including infrastructure and tools</li>
      <li>Supporter: you support others that cannot afford their travel, stay and food</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>We are expected to pay 500 INR/person/day for the venue.</p>
